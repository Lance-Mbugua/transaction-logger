Black-Box Testing
Objective: Validate functionality without access to internal code.

Test Cases:

TC1: Run script with sample data
Expected: Logs 4 transactions and shows summary (e.g., Salary: $1500.00, Groceries: $75.00)

TC2: Add transaction with invalid amount (0)
Expected: Raises ValueError: "Invalid category or amount"

TC3: Add transaction with empty category
Expected: Raises ValueError: "Invalid category or amount"

Results: âœ… All test cases passed, ensuring accurate logging and summarization.

White-Box Testing
Objective: Validate internal logic (not implemented due to CLI simplicity).
Note: Focused on black-box testing for output validation.
